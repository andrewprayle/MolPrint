# MolPrint

A Blender add-on that provides a variety of tools for processing molecular models for 3D printing.

Typically, VRML2 scenes generated from PyMol or Chimera are imported through MolPrint. Ball and stick models can "pinned" to allow objects to printed as separate pieces and put together after printing.
